<h3 style="text-align:left">Sound has been part of my creative practice for some time. As a teenager, I started a bluegrass and folk band with my sisters. In between touring festivals, county fairs, and other small vengues, we recorded our first CD on at home. The process of recording was infuriating and electrifying––despite an enormous learning curve, I was hooked.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align:left">Later, when I began to research technology and the body, I found myself turning to back to sound and sound recording. Writing about sonic experiences in <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/digital-sound-studies">"Sound Practices for Digital Humanities,"</a> Steph Ceraso observes that, "while not every sonic encounter is as exhilarating as a rollercoaster ride, it is not unusual to experience sound as a sensorially invigorating event." 
  
<p>The extent to which sound radically interacts with and even reshapes embodied experience came clear to me as I wrote journal articles about <a href="https://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/74/1/30">Thoreau's reaction to the telegraph lines thrumming through "pristine" natural landscapes</a> and the way one woman's silence calls attention to embodiment in the sonically rich setting of the seashore. (For the latter, see "'Her who never spoke': Oral/Aural Disability, the Female Voice, and the Deafened Moment in M.E. Braddon’s ‘Waiting.’” on <a href="/_pages/credentials.html">my CV</a>.) It became even clearer as I embarked on my own soundwriting project: a public humanities and history podcast called <a href="https://victorianscribblers.com"><em>Victorian Scribblers</em></a>. While editing episodes, I learned to recognize the shapes of my breath, my verbal ticks, and my laughter.</h3>
