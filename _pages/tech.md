<h1>Technology</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:left"> As a scholar of historical as well as contemporary technology and media, I define technology quite broadly to include everything from crochet to the book to cyber physical systems and AI. What that means, practically speaking, is that (1) my engagements with technology are many and varied, and (2) I am interested in the way various technologies intersect with sociopolitical issues as well as personal wellbeing. 
  
<p>In the nineteenth century, makers like William Morris strategically turned to "old" and "outdated" technologies not only to make political statements (Morris was an outspoken socialist, for example) but also to push back against the encroachments of new technology upon day to day life. Although they made use of what were then cutting edge technologies (such as photographic printing), they were wary of mass production, mass media, automation, and homogeneity. In this context, something like crochet or embroidery becomes a revolutionary technology with which to mediate one's lived experience of the world.</p>

<p>All of which is to explain that I include items like "learning to sew" alongside "learning to code in Python" because, I contend, both are creative-critical activities which make use of technology.<p>

<h3>DH Projects</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:left"><img align="left"><a href="https://humebib.github.io/"><img src="/images/hume.png" alt="Portrait of Fergus Hume" width="200" height="200"></a>The <a href="https://humebib.github.io/" text-align="center">Fergus Hume Bibliography and Corpus</a> is a website and Github repository I built in 2019 in an attempt to gather bibliographic information about Hume's various works in one place and begin compiling a corpus of his public domain works. Fergusson "Fergus" Wright Hume (8 July 1859 – 12 July 1932) was a British novelist, playwright, and song writer who grew up in New Zealand and authored more than 140 novels during his lifetime. His most famous work was <em>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</em> (1886), a novel which did a lot to popularize the mystery genre. Despite his initial popularity and prolificity, Hume has been largely forgotten by the public and overlooked by scholars. The website includes a sortable bibliography, nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century reviews of Hume's work, and twenty-first century reference works about Hume and his writing. The GitHub repository contains Python scripts to automatically download plain text files of the novels, collections, and short stories of Hume's which have been made freely available online via Project Gutenberg, Hathitrust, and/or the Internet Archive; plain text files of those works; and a .csv bibliography.</h3>

<h2>Text and Corpus Building and Analysis</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left"> I have experience with a variety of text analysis and mining tools, ranging from internet applications (Voyant Tools, Wordle) to open source programs such as AntConc. I am currently learning how to use Python for text analysis, and have successfully used it to build a corpus of public domain texts (see the Fergus Hume project, below).</h3>

<h3>Dissertation Data</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:left">I compiled three corpora (totaling over 155 Victorian novels and novellas) while writing the final chapter of my dissertation.
Because I believe data sets should be shared when possible, I've uploaded them to a GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/DrCFloyd/C19Corpora">here</a>.

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/DrCFloyd/C19Corpora/tree/master/VBC">The Victorian Bestseller Corpus</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/DrCFloyd/C19Corpora/tree/master/ACC">The Author Character Corpus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DrCFloyd/C19Corpora/tree/master/EliotCorpus">The Eliot Corpus</a></li>
 </ul></h3>
