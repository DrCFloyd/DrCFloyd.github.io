<h3><strong>BODY</strong>: The complete physical form of a person or animal; the assemblage of parts, organs, and tissues that constitutes the whole material organism. (<em>OED</em> def. 1a)</h3>

<h3 style="text-align:left">
Bodies and issues of embodiment provide a throughline through my research and practice. In my current position, I work to support active, whole-person learning through technology, and I am particularly interested in issues of accessibility. My research enacts several interventions into questions of embodiment, from critical disability studies to the embodied experience of gender to racially Othered bodies in literature. Of particular note is my forthcoming article with <em>Victorian Review</em>, “‘Take it When Tendered’: M.E. Braddon’s Thou Art the Man (1894) and The Weekly Telegraph’s Media Model of Disability.”

<h2>Disability Studies in the Classroom</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left">As a Graduate Fellow at the University of Oregon, I developed the following Writing course, in which students and I not only focused on disability, but made accessibility and embodiment an integral part of our learning and community building.</h3> <br>
