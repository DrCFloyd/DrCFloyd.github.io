<h3><strong>BODY</strong>: The complete physical form of a person or animal; the assemblage of parts, organs, and tissues that constitutes the whole material organism. (<em>OED</em> def. 1a)</h3>

<h3 style="text-align:left">
Bodies and issues of embodiment provide a throughline through my research and practice. In my current position, I work to support active, whole-person learning through technology, and I am particularly interested in issues of accessibility. My research enacts several interventions into questions of embodiment, from critical disability studies to the embodied experience of gender to racially Othered bodies in literature. Of particular note is my forthcoming article with <em>Victorian Review</em>, “‘Take it When Tendered’: M.E. Braddon’s <em>Thou Art the Man</em> (1894) and the <em>Weekly Telegraph’s</em> Media Model of Disability.”

<h2>Disability Studies in the Classroom</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left">As a Graduate Fellow at the University of Oregon, I developed the following Writing course, in which students and I not only focused on disability, but made accessibility and embodiment an integral part of our learning and community building.</h3> <br>

<h2>Sounding the Body</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left">What happens when you ask 30+ people to record themselves reading an iconic passage from Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em>, "Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful," and then visualize those recordings? In a <em>Frankenreads</em> event I organized in 2018, I found out. In between helping people who had never recorded before learn to navigate the microphone and digital audio workstation I had set up, I got to watch students, faculty, and staff––all stressed out by the approach of midterms––straighten their shoulders, lift their chins, and, however momentarily, bask in the power of those words emanating from their lips. We compared their visualized recordings, noting the ways that some readers got louder with the word "powerful," the way some dawdled through the words as if their power had never been in question, the way others belted the whole fragment, decibels clipping with their enthusiasm. For reasons of confidentiality, I can't share those recordings here. But, I can share a small selection of the visualizations:
