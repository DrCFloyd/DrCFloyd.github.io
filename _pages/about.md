<h1>About Courtney</h1>
<p>I earned my Ph.D. in English at the University of Oregon, where I specialized in Victorian literature and print culture. 
My dissertation, “Printing the Other Victorians: Nineteenth-Century Fictions of Embodiment and Identity,” drew on materialist methodologies from periodical studies, archival studies, and the digital humanities to examine embodiment and embodied identity as they manifest in and through newspapers, novels, advertisements, archives, and more.</p>

<p> Currently, I'm Director of Transformative Technologies at University of Virginia’s Contemplative Sciences Center. 
I work with faculty, staff, and graduate students across all 11 of UVA’s schools to promote deep, experiential learning and student flourishing in and beyond the classroom through strategic technology use. </p> These days, I'm particularly interested in disability and accessibility, especially in the digital world, and sound studies.

When I'm not wearing any of the above hats, you'll probably find me <a href="https://www.victorianscribblers.com">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://courtney-floyd.com">writing fiction</a>, creating elaborate vegetarian recipes, or playing with my dogs.
