Sometimes, a book catches your eye over and over again until you finally give in and bring it home EVEN THOUGH it isn't quite the kind of thing you normally work with.

<p>Harold MacGrath's <em>Arms and the Woman: A Romance </em>(1899) is one of those books. The cover and title kept catching my eye. So I caved, and now I'm blogging about it.</p>

<p>The edition I picked up was published by A.L. Burt Company out of New York. It's printed on dandy-rolled wove paper with at least some linen content. The publisher's binding is red cloth with black stamping and a half-tone photo onlay, the title is white-stamped in contrast.</p>

<p>As you can see, the title page is an interesting mix of fonts (including some Gothic) and decorative elements. It appears to be woodcut.</p>

There is evidence of stereotyping throughout the volume. You'll notice a pattern of wear on the last line of many pages -- either they're blurry or extra bold or both.</h2>
