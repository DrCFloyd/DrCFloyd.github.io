<h1>Burnett's <em>The Shuttle</em> (1906/7)</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:left">
First of all, my apologies for the late post. I thought I'd saved a draft but it had not in fact saved.

<p>This week, we're taking a peek at Frances Hodgson Burnett's <em>The</em> Shuttle, which the internet tells me was published in 1907 but which the copyright notices in this edition sort of contradict.</p>

<p>Published by Grosset & Dunlap in 1907, this volume is bound in tan cloth with black stamping on the front cover and spine. The front cover also includes a color-halftone onlay, as seen above. The back cover is blank.</p>

One of the previous owners scrawled her name (and the date) on the endpapers and flyleaf recto.

<p>As mentioned above, the copyright is of some interest as it seems to contradict established publication dates. I suspect (but have not had time to determine) that the novel was serialized in The Century Company's magazine.</p>

The title page. You'll note there is pronounced foxing.
