<h1>Little Luxart Library Editions (1920s)</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Hello all, and Happy New Year!

<p>My little book history blog series is back from its brief hiatus with a short stack of interesting editions which<a href="https://www.abebooks.com/rare-books/collecting/little-leather-library.shtml"> probably came free with a box of chocolate</a>. (Follow the link for an interesting mini-lesson in American book history.)</p>

<p>Produced by Robert K. Haas, Inc. from 1924+ (and by the Little Leather Library corporation between 1916-1923), these editions aren't much to look at, aside from the novelty of their size. Made with high wood-pulp paper which is extremely foxed and brittle now, they made literary classics (and not-so-classics) available to a wider public.</p>

<p>These editions are bound inÂ either <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/books/rarebooks/collecting-guide/understanding-rare-books/understanding-bindings.shtml" target="_blank">roan or skiver </a>(I'm not well-versed in leather bindings, but considering the cheapness of the editions, I'd guess it's skiver), which has been dyed red and blind stamped with simple borders and titles.</p>

But this shot gives you a good sense of the printing quality. Narrow margins, lots of lines, lots of ink blotting.<br>
