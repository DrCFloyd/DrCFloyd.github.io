<h1>Dana Jr.'s Two Years Before the Mast (1911, 1916)</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:left">I stumbled across two very different illustrated editions of Richard Henry Dana Jr.'s <em>Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative </em>the other day while thrifting. Originally published in 1840, this travel narrative includes a visit to California Territory. I read it during my Master's program and remember it fondly.

<p>The first edition, a green cloth-bound volume published in 1911 by Houghton Mifflin Co. as part of the Riverside Literature Series, purports to be a "new illustrated edition with a supplement by the author and introduction and additional chapter by his son."</p>

<p>The design has been printed on the front cover, as well as on the back cover and spine.</p>

<p>The paper is wove, the endpapers are plain.</p>

<p>Inside, there is a frontispiece facing the title page.</p>

<p>The frontispiece looks like a gravure, as does the the other full page illustration which appears after page 258 in this edition.</p>

The remainder of the illustrations (there are many) are woodcut.

<p>In addition to a number of informational illustrations, the book includes appendices and a pictorial glossary of ship terms.</p>

<p>It's clearly created with adults in mind, though the illustrations may have been a draw for child readers as well.</p>

<p>The second edition, also bound in green cloth, was published by David McKay of Philadelphia in 1916. It's a children's edition, part of McKay's The Golden Books series. Of course, <em>Two Years Before the Mast </em>was not written as a children's book, and as recently as 1911 had been published in a nicely illustrated adult-oriented volume, so this publishing strategem--and the edition itself--was a bit of a surprise to me.</p>

<p>Its cover is an onlay color-halftone print. It's poorly done--you can see the misaligned edges even without a loupe.</p>

On the spine, the title, author, and published have been stamped in gilt.

<p>The back cover, as is usually the case (at least in my posts so far) is plain.</p>

<p>The endpapers are decorated with a green design that looks like the work of chromolithography to me.</p>

<p>The paper itself is wove.</p>

<p>The title page verso tells us that the copyright for the edition is held by Macmillan. It also informs us that the edition was <strong>electrotyped</strong>, which means that once the type was set , molds were taken, and each plate was reproduced using copper via the electrotype process. You can see a video about electrotyping (though not for print) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTytvWs5nV8" target="_blank">here</a>. So very cool.</p>

<p>The color illustrations are tipped in on glossy paper. they are muddy color-halftones.</p>

<p>I will say that the choice of very vivid color lends these illustrations (mostly landscapes) a distinctly surreal, perhaps exotic feel. So, the book's emphasis on exploring "unknown" territory does come through in them quite well.</p>

<p>Probably because of the addition of color, the number of illustrations in this edition is much reduced. Consequently, it doesn't feel quite like a children's book (although by late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century standards this isn't really an issue).</p>

<p>The children's edition bears more signs of reading. In fact, it's quite beat up compared to the other. So, maybe marketing it to children was a way to salvage it from being forgotten. Its content doesn't appear to have been altered for this edition (though I haven't done any careful comparison to check).</p>

 
**Apologies about the shadows in the photographs. This winter light is wreaking havoc on my already limited set up. I'll see what I can do about it for next time.**</h2>
