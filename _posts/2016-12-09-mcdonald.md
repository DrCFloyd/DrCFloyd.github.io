<h1>MacDonald's <em>At the Back of the North Wind</em> (1924?)<h1>

<h2 style="text-align:left">There's not a whole lot to say about today's book: A 1920s edition of George MacDonald's Victorian children's book, <em>At the Back of the North Wind</em>, published by David McKay of Philadelphia. Hathitrust dates this edition, which includes four color plates by Gertrude A Kay, to 1924. Based on the cover and illustration style (color-halftone of the sorts we've seen in the last few posts) anything from the 1910s to 1920s makes sense to me.

<p>My  edition is bound in red cloth, with a color-halftone onlay on the front cover:</p>

<p>The spine is simple black text directly on the cover.</p>

<p>There's a bookplate on the inside front cover, partially obscuring what looks like a color lithograph endpaper design.</p>

<p>The paper is wove, and the typeface looks fairly modern. Aside from the four color-halftone illustrations, the book is pretty plain.</p>

<p>The initial letter of each chapter is epigraphic, but otherwise the actual text is very simple:</p>

<p>I'm noticing that illustrations in children's books use a LOT of orange (based on the handful I've discussed on this blog, anyway). To me, it seems a bit garish, but maybe kids just really liked orange things in the early twentieth-century:</p>

<p>It's been a number of years, but I remember this being a fun read--particularly if you enjoy nineteenth-century children's literature as I do. You can listen to it for free at <a href="https://librivox.org/at-the-back-of-the-north-wind-by-george-macdonald-2/" target="_blank">Librivox</a>, or read it for free at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/225" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>--so if you're looking for something interesting to do with the kiddos (or on your own), this might be of interest.</p>

Until next time!</h2>
