title: Listening Outward at NAVSA 2018
posted-by: Courtney Floyd

<h2 style="text-align:left">This year for the National Victorian Studies Association (NAVSA) Conference, I transcribed two songs which were printed in <em>The Weekly Telegraph </em>in 1894. My paper, "Printing Synesthesia: Sensory Epistemologies in the Nineteenth-Century Newspaper," was part of a panel in which I, Kate Nesbit (U Iowa), Miranda Butler (UC Riverside), and Shannon Draucker (Boston U) explored the intersections of sound, embodiment, and knowledge. It was a fascinating panel, and I'm so delighted to call these brilliant women my colleagues and friends.

For my presentation, I converted these songs to midi files and shared them with my audience. Because of the publication context, I think it's fairly safe to say that panel attendees were the first people to hear these songs for about 120 years. You can listen too, below. I'll also be posting excerpts from our panel over on <a href="http://www.victorianscribblers.com"><em>Victorian Scribblers</em>.</a></h2>
