<h2 style="text-align:left"><img src="/images/IMG_7333.JPG" alt="Photo of Courtney wearing bright lipstick and a colorful print dress" width="200" height="200" style="text-align:left">I earned my Ph.D. in English at the <a href="english.uoregon.edu">University of Oregon</a>, where I specialized in Victorian literature and print culture and disability studies. 
My dissertation, “Printing the Other Victorians: Nineteenth-Century Fictions of Embodiment and Identity,” drew on materialist methodologies from periodical studies, archival studies, and the digital humanities 
to examine embodiment and embodied identity (including disability, gender identity, sexuality, and race) as they manifest in and through newspapers, novels, advertisements, archives, and more.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:right">Currently, I'm Director of Transformative Technologies at University of Virginia’s <a href="https://csc.virginia.edu/">Contemplative Sciences Center</a>. I work with faculty, staff, and graduate students across all 
12 of UVA’s schools to promote deep, experiential learning and student flourishing in and beyond the classroom through strategic technology use.<h2>

 <ul>
   <li>disability and accessibility</li>
   <li>technology, nature, and fulness (see my recent article in <a href="https://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/74/1/30"><emphasis>Nineteenth-Century Literature</emphasis></a></li>
   <li>digital life (everything from user experience to social media to data privacy, informed consent, and what Ruha Benjamin calls "informed refusal")</li>
   <li>sound studies</li>
   <li>public humanities and history</li>
   <li>critical making</li>
 </ul></h2>
