<h2 text-align="left">I am Director of Transformative Technologies at the University of Virginia's Contemplative Sciences Center. 
My academic background is in Victorian literature and print culture and critical disability studies. I am interested in embodied identity
as it manifests in, shapes, and is shaped by communications technologies (particularly sound recording and playing technologies). 
I use Digital and Public Humanities skills to assist faculty, staff, and students to leverage technology for academic and personal wellbeing.</h2>
