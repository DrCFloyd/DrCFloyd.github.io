<h2 style="text-align:left">I earned my Ph.D. in English at the <a href="english.uoregon.edu">University of Oregon</a>, where I specialized in Victorian literature and print culture and disability studies. 
My dissertation, “Printing the Other Victorians: Nineteenth-Century Fictions of Embodiment and Identity,” drew on materialist methodologies from periodical studies, archival studies, and the digital humanities 
to examine embodiment and embodied identity (including disability, gender identity, sexuality, and race) as they manifest in and through newspapers, novels, advertisements, archives, and more.<br>

Currently, I'm Director of Transformative Technologies at University of Virginia’s <a href="https://csc.virginia.edu/">Contemplative Sciences Center</a>. I work with faculty, staff, and graduate students across all 
12 of UVA’s schools to promote deep, experiential learning and student flourishing in and beyond the classroom through strategic technology use. 

These days, I'm particularly interested in 
 <ul>
   <li>disability and accessibility</li>
   <li>technology, nature, and fulness (see my recent article in <a href="https://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/74/1/30"><emphasis>Nineteenth-Century Literature</emphasis></a></li>
   <li>digital life (everything from user experience to social media to data privacy, informed consent, and what Ruha Benjamin calls "informed refusal")</li>
   <li>sound studies</li>
   <li>public humanities and history</li>
   <li>critical making</li>
  </ul>
     
I am the creator and producer of <a href="www.victorianscribblers.com"><emphasis>Victorian Scribblers</emphasis></a>,
a biography and literature podcast about the nineteenth-century writers time forgot. I've done some work transcribing historical scores that were originally published in British newspapers.  
  
When I'm not wearing any of the above hats, you'll probably find me creating an audio drama, writing fiction, crafting elaborate vegetarian recipes, teaching myself to sew, or playing with my dogs.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:left">I am Director of Transformative Technologies at the University of Virginia's Contemplative Sciences Center. 
My academic background is in Victorian literature and print culture and critical disability studies. I am interested in embodied identity
as it manifests in, shapes, and is shaped by communications technologies (particularly sound recording and playing technologies). 
I use Digital and Public Humanities skills to assist faculty, staff, and students to leverage technology for academic and personal wellbeing.</h2>
