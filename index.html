<h2 style="text-align:left">I earned my Ph.D. in English at the <a href="english.uoregon.edu">University of Oregon</a>, where I specialized in Victorian literature and print culture and disability studies. 
My dissertation, “Printing the Other Victorians: Nineteenth-Century Fictions of Embodiment and Identity,” drew on materialist methodologies from periodical studies, archival studies, and the digital humanities 
to examine embodiment and embodied identity (including disability, gender identity, sexuality, and race) as they manifest in and through newspapers, novels, advertisements, archives, and more.</h2>

 <h2 style="text-align:left"> These days, I'm particularly interested in: 
 <ul>
   <li>disability and accessibility</li>
   <li>technology and nature (see my article in <a href="https://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/74/1/30"><em>Nineteenth-Century Literature</em></a></li>
   <li>digital life (everything from user experience to social media to data privacy, informed consent, and what Ruha Benjamin calls "informed refusal")</li>
   <li>sound studies</li>
   <li>public humanities and history</li>
   <li>critical making</li>
 </ul></h2>
